# GestureClasifer

This repository is a demo gesture classifier. It aims to determine if a gesture is positive or negative.

# Usage.

I assume that you will use Google Colab to run the classifier.
So, for that there are some simple steps:

1) Download the Dataset and upload it to your Google Drive.
2) Open the notebook on Google Colab. There is a link on the file "GesturesCalssification.ipynb" that will redirect to there.
3) Connect to a Runtime and set the notebook for GPU usage: RunTime >> Change Runtime type >> and on Hardware Accelerator, select GPU.
4) Follow the steps explained on the notebook to run training and prediction processes
